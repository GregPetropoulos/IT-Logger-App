### Landing Page Image
![Hero](./client//src//image/hero.jpg)


An internal app ticketing system for IT Department's to trouble-shoot and communicate with techs using a system log entries and server up/down status. A tech can create a log and prioritize the issue. If the logs needs further details the has edit capabilities to make changes to the log. Once the issue is resolved a tech can delete the issue.

## Demo

[Deployed Link on Render](https://it-support.onrender.com/)

<small> **The app is hosted on render which can take 45-60 seconds to fully spin up sleep servers on first load</small>

## Lessons Learned

**Challenges**
- Setting token to be checked for all request, adjusting store subscriber and when to loadTech()
- Multiple checkboxes with local state
- Materialize css for edit modal, had to use Material Select component
- Filter state vs filter DB

## Stretch Goals

- Error checking state and component
- Add charts for server and tech statistics
- Change StatusCards for server status to be manage by Redux
- Add Profile
- Tag a tech on a log
- Up time and Down time Warnings
- Upload an screenshot to the log
- Comment on a specific log similar to slack channels

## API Reference
There are three core API categories and more detail can be found at the postman docs

![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=for-the-badge&logo=postman&logoColor=white)
- [Techs API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18334011/2s9YR9YsYH)
```javascript
/api/techs
```
- [Logs API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18334011/2s9YR9YsTv)
```javascript
/api/logs
```
- [Auth API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18334011/2s9YR9YYSK)
```javascript
/api/auth
```

# Routes
- Protected routes for each tech.
- Each Tech can Create Read Updated Delete (CRUD) a log in their own private view. Once Ready a tech can add log to public interface
- Outside of a tech's log they can read only all other logs 
- Routes that are protected are by design of middleware for checking tokens and valid database id's

## MongoDB (NoSQL)

The database has two collections:

1. logs

2. techs

Logs are cross referenced by the techs id that created the log

The collections are created by the mongoose schema in the models folder. The log schema is associated to the tech schema by objectId.

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const LogSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  // *Specific to a users logs
    tech:{
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'techs'
    },
```

***This allows the tech to have their own private view of the logs on their account.***

## Server Side Validation

The express-validator npm package was utilized to handle the backend validation for `Registration`, `Login`, and `Log routes`.
The validation comes after the auth middleware,

```
check('firstName','A first name is required').not.isEmpty(), (req,res)....
```

`.not` negates the result of the next validator in the chain and the `.isEmpty()` returns a boolean value for no errors within the result object
https://express-validator.github.io/docs/validation-result-api.html#isempty

## Authentication

A tech will have an authenticated route to login into after being registered. A middleware is used at login to check and verify the JSON Web Token. The tech.id is then stored in the payload to be used as reference of the logged in user.

### JSON Web Token (JWT)

The JSON Web Token is used to identify tech in the db by header, payload data, and signature
[JWT](https://jwt.io/)
